1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move the App Web Service to an instance on the private subnet.


2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

VPC private endpoints make s3 buckets accessible by applications that are on-prem over VPN and AWS Direct Connect or are in a different AWS region over VPC peering. So no, the bucket is not made more secure by creating VPC private endpoints. 


3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. Enabling bucket encryption will not encrypt objects that are already in it.


4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

Making changes in the console or cli to infrastructure created by Cloud Formation is called 'drift' and it's a problem. Cloud Formation has a tool to detect drift. If there is drift, the original cloud formation templates will fail to run.

Identify tools that will allow you to do the following and for each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.

a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 
Since our project uses Cloud Formation for IaC, some choices of tools for scanning the CF templates are Cfripper, Cloudsploit and can-lint.
Examples of violations and vulnerabilities caught by these tools are:
- servers exposed publicly to the internet
- unencrypted data storage
- lack of least-privilege policies
- poor password policies or missing MFA
- misconfigured backup and restore settings
- data exposure and privilege escalation


b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 


Open source: 
Clair for static analysis of application containers 
Anchore checks container apps for vulnerabilities, secrets, exposed ports, elevated previleges
Dagda for static scanning to detect trojans, malware, and viruses in docker images and containers.
Trivy for IaC vulnerabilities
Privy for security practices and policies
OpenSCAP tools automate vulnerability management, measurement and policy compliance against a set of standards.

Commercial:
Aqua security builds on open source Trivy to scan source code, repositories, images, artifact registries, IaC templates and Kubernetes environments. 
sysdig scans IaC for security issues
twistlock (now Prisma Cloud) provides vulnerability management by scanning images and server less functions
PureSec scans server less functions for vulnerabilities, access permissions, and runtime threats



c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.

As we saw in this lab...

AWS Inspector finds vulnerabilities on EC2 instances. It runs either once a day or every 15 minutes, which is considered static scanning. It doesn't run on demand. AWS Inspector does the following:
- catches deviation from the CIS Benchmarks (Center for Internet Security)
- reports on deviation from AWS security best practices
- reports on common vulnerabilities and exposure
- reports on network reachability from the internet to EC2 instances and load balancers

AWS Config continuously monitors and records AWS resource configurations and compares against desired configurations.

AWS Security Hub provides a comprehensive view of the state of your security and checks against industry standards and best practices.

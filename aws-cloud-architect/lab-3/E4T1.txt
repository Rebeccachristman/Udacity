1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

- Move the App Web Service EC2 instance to a private subnet so it cannot be reached from the Internet.
- Change the inbound rules security group rules for the App Web Service to allow traffic only on port 5000.
- Disallow ssh to the App Web Service EC2 and require maintenance be done using the AWS console.
- As suggested in Optional Task3, an AWS WAF could be put in front of the ALB to block unwanted URL traffic.

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
- Block public access
- Add a bucket policy to the secret recipe bucket to allow access only to the role that needs access.

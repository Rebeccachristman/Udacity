1. What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?
If Guard Duty had worked properly, I would have seen "UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce" indicating an EC2 instance has been involved in SSH brute force attack.



2. Take a screenshot of the Guard Duty findings specific to the attack. Title this screenshot E3T1_guardduty.png.

Guard Duty never updated to show the brute force attack. I checked the Udaciy Mentor help and found this article (https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/838057) saying this is a known problem with Guard Duty.
The mentorâ€™s suggestion is to make note of the problem and submit the assignment.


3. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?
Guard Duty detects a brute force attack using the VPC Flow Logs. Guard Duty doesn't require that you have enabled VPC Flow logging although you can and should!
Guard Duty uses logs that are kept behind the scenes by Amazon.

Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.


AWS Config found the following vulnerabilities:
- Both S3 buckets (cand-c3-free-recipes, cand-c3-secret-recipes) lack server access logging
- Both EC2 instances allow restricted ssh connections


AWS Inspector found the following vulnerabilities:
The web service instance has three vulerabilities:
- Port ranges 0 to 65535 are reachable from the Internet
- Port 80 is reachable from the Internet
- Port 22 is reachable from the Internet
The Attack Instance has 1 vulnerability:
- Port 22 is reachable from the Internet


AWS Security Hub found the following vulnerabilities:
Security Hub found 3 high severity violations for both of the EC2 instances deployed for this project.
- EC2.9 EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
- EC2.8 EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
- SSM.1 EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager



Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Enable server access logging on S3 buckets (cand-c3-free-recipes, cand-c3-secret-recipes).
Enable encryption on both S3 buckets.
EC2 Web Service instance should be moved to a private subnet with a security group allowing inbound traffic only on port 5000 from the ALB.
EC2 Web Service instance should allow management only from the AWS Systems Manager console.

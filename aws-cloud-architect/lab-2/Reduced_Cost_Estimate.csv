"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

Changes to reduce cost:
Web tier EC2 use single burstable instance in place of 2 auto-scaling instances in each Availability Zone (AZ)
App tier EC2 use single burstable instance in place of 3 auto-scaling instances per AZ
S3 storage archive a larger percentage into Glacier
Neptune primary instance switch to lower cost burstable  
No change to NAT and load balancing to handle the network load
CloudFront content delivery to users stayed the same to ensure good response times to users
